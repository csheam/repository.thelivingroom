[COLOR red][B]Online Release Version 2.0.04[/B][/COLOR]
- AD fix.
- Reinstate Upload Manager, but I have disabled the Rollback Feature.
- Added settings General->Manage Addon Updates... "Github Username" & "Github Repo Address". In these, you can enter the username and repo address of another dev who may wish to push a Fen Light release. Devs will need to check the code within updater.py and make sure their repo is structured correctly. Basically repo_name/packages/CONTENT.
